I am a PhD candidate in the Biosemantics group at Leiden University Medical Centre, where I study the FAIR principles, the use of foundational ontologies for translational research, and how methods from software engineering can be repurposed to improve bioinformatics research. In 2020, I received my Master's degree in Software Engineering from the Federal University of Esp√≠rito Santo in Brazil.
