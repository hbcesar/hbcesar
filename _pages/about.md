I am passionate about leveraging conceptual modelling and ontologies to transform health and life sciences research, making it more transparent and impactful. My work focuses on the principle that well-structured, ontology-based data significantly improves the performance and explainability of AI and Machine Learning systems.

With a foundation in software engineering and expertise spanning the FAIR principles and the semantic web, I thrive on interdisciplinary collaboration. My goal is to enhance how data is shared, integrated, and reused across complex domains.
