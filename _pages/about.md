I am a PhD candidate in the Biosemantics group at Leiden University Medical Centre, where I study the FAIR principles, the use of foundational ontologies to improve machine learning and explainable AI, and how methods from software engineering can be repurposed to improve bioinformatics research. In 2020, I received my Master's degree in Software Engineering from the Federal University of Esp√≠rito Santo in Brazil.

Next to my PhD, I also work as a FAIR Data Steward at the (European Joint Programme on Rare Diseases (EJP RD))[https://www.ejprarediseases.org/services-and-events/fairification-stewardship-programme-for-ern-registries/].
